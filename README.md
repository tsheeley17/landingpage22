# landingpage22

Landing Page Project for The Odin Project Landing Page Project. 

This was an interesting project. It really challenged my skill and make me devel into online resources to expand my knowledge. 

This project uses HTML and CSS that I wrote from scratch. It mainly focues on the use of flexbox to make the page more interactive/mobile friendly.

I plan to return to this project at a future date and fill in the info to make it a more fun and interactive webpage but for now it is a good representation of what I have learned so far.
